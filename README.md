# Mice Tumor Pharmaceutical Analysis
## Module 5 Challenge (Data Visualization)
In this challenge, we are using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to manipulate and analyze data for a pharmaceutical company. Various drug regimens were given to 249 mice who all have tumors caused from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. Looking at factors such as tumor volume, weight, and the partiular drug regimen, we discovered the folliwing conclusions:
- There were 2% more male mice than female
- Capomulin and Ramicane had the smallest average tumor volumes
- Capomulin and Ramicane had smaller final tumor volumes than Infubinol and Ceftamin
- For a specific mouse (Mouse ID: l509), under the regimen of Capomulin, the tumor volume did begin to decrease significantly after day 20
- There was a positive correlation between tumor volume and weight for mice under the Capolumin regimen
